# This is an example/template for and ETL dataset configuration
# It is designed to represent the data provenance of data extracted
# from and source out in the wild, transformed, and then loaded
# into your controlled data storage (e.g. blob storage).
# Datasets extracted from uncontrolled sources should be
# considered unstable and subject to change without notice.
# Thus, it is recommended to store the raw extracted data
# as well as the transformed data in your controlled storage.
# This example uses a CDC data source, but you can use any
# publicly available data source. any value in curly braces {}
# should be replaced with your own values as needed.
