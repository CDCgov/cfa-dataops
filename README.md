# CFA Scenarios DataOps

## Overview

This project provides ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for various data scenarios within the CDC's Center for Analytics (CFA). It currently includes an end-to-end ETL pipeline data, demonstrating best practices for data processing within the CFA environment.

### Key Features

- Configuration-driven ETL pipelines using TOML files
- SQL-based transformations using DuckDB
- Azure Blob Storage integration for raw and transformed data storage
- Utilities for timestamping and template loading
- Data validation and quality checks

## Getting started

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (**requires: `poetry >= 2.0`**):
   ```
   poetry install
   ```
3. Example: run the COVID-19 vaccination trends ETL pipeline:
   ```
   python -m cfa.scenarios.dataops.etl.covid19vax_trends --extract
   ```
4. [Optional] installing developer dependencies:
   ```
   poetry install --with dev
   ```

To add a new dataset:
1. Create a new TOML configuration file in `cfa/scenarios/dataops/datasets/`
2. Create a new ETL script in `cfa/scenarios/dataops/etl/`
3. Add SQL transformation templates in `cfa/scenarios/dataops/etl/transform_templates/`

## Accessing Datasets

When the ETL pipelines are run, the data sources (raw and/or transformed) are stored into Azure Blob Storage. There will be times when we want to access these datasets directly. The function `get_data()` found in `cfa.scenarios.dataops.datasets.catalog` helps retrieve that data, compile into a single dataframe, and return that dataframe. The parameters for `get_data()` are as follows:
- name: the name of the data source
- version: either 'latest' or string containing the datetime of required version. Default is 'latest'.
- type: either 'raw' or 'transformed'. Default is 'transformed'.
- output: the type of dataframe to output, either 'pandas' or 'polars'. Default is 'pandas'.

The available datasets can be found by running `list_datasets()`, which can be found in the `cfa.scenarios.dataops.datasets.catalog` submodule.

An example for getting the polars dataframes for the latest raw versions of the covid19vax_trends and seroprevalence datasets is below:
```python
from cfa.scenarios.dataops.datasets.catalog import get_data
vax_df = get_data("covid19vax_trends", type = "transformed", output = "polars")
sero_df = get_data("seroprevalence", type = "transformed", output = "polars")
```

## Creating A Release

This repository contains a workflow for creating releases called release.yaml. When ready to create a new release follow the steps below.
When creating a release tag follow the versioning pattern: `YYYY.MM.DD.micro(a/b/{none if release})

```bash
git checkout release
git pull
export RELEASE=YYYY.MM.DD
git commit --allow-empty -m "Release $RELEASE"
git tag -a $RELEASE -m "Version $RELEASE"
git push --tags 
```

Once a release tag in format YYYY.MM.DD is pushed the workflow will automate the process of creating a new release automatically.
